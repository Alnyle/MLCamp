# package contains various function to perform specific tasks

# example math contains sqrt() function to calculate the
# the square root of a number

# when working on big project you to split your code other it's will be messy
# instead you can seperate your code into mutliple files by keeping
# the related code togther in one package

#  A directory must contain a file named __init__.py in order 
# for Python to consider it as a package This file can be left empty but we 
# generally place the initialization code for that package in this file.


# how to import from package inside module

# from Game.Level import start

# or

# import Game.Level.start

# start.select_difficulty(2)


# import function directly

# from Game.Level.start import select_difficulty
