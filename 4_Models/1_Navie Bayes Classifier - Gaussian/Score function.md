**ChatGPT:**

The `score()` function in scikit-learn evaluates the performance of a machine learning model on the test data.

For classification models like `GaussianNB`, the `score()` function returns the **accuracy** of the model, which is the proportion of correct predictions made on the test data (`X_test`) compared to the true labels (`y_test`).

### How it works:

* The model makes predictions on `X_test`.
* The predicted labels are compared to the actual labels (`y_test`).
* The accuracy is computed as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.

### Formula for Accuracy:

$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}}$$

### Example:

```python
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

If the accuracy is `0.85`, it means the model correctly predicted 85% of the test samples.

For regression models, the `score()` function typically returns the **RÂ² score** (coefficient of determination).
